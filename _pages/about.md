I can still feel the weight of those early COVID pandemic days when the world seemed to pause. The news of a rapidly spreading virus filled every headline, and with it came an overwhelming question: Could this have been prevented? Amid this chaos, I found myself reflecting on a quote by Edward Deming: “In God we trust; all others must bring data.” Those words stuck with me as I started my Masters’s in Engineering Data Science at University Of Houston.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
